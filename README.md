# Code-Challenge-IS
This was fun, thanks for the opportunity, I have worke with c++ and arduino, which is kind of C, but never with C#
Its very similar and all but still was fun to investigate how to use the proper functions.
As you can see I made it kind of wird or simple, I know that assuming the blank space between pulsations was not in the instruccions but I couldnt think in any other option, casue you know if you press "555 555" or "555555" in thouse usually is a way around the letters in case you got confused and insted of earsing you just maje a way around or its gives you access to special characters

my commnets and explanation is in the code, Im using this to explain some of my expirience doing this and considerations I make in it
Thanks for the oportunity and I hope to hear about this opportunity soon
Bye
